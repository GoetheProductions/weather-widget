## A few of my notes for further improvements ##
Due to the time limitation, I was not able to make all the tests i wanted to. Here are a few that could have improved the testing environment:

 - Could have made a test for WidgetItem
 - Could have made test for the input in SearchForm
 - Could have made test for button in SearchForm
 - Could have made test for disabled button on empty input


### eslint
 Furthermore eslint should be properly implemented. I experienced a strange and unusual bug in my setup, that i did not have time to dive into.


### scss-modules
 Another thing that could be implemented, but i did not get to work with the build environment is scss-modules
